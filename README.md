# Demultiplexing Algorithm

An algorithm to separate dual-matched unique index bar codes of Illumina sequencing 
data into respective unique index files. This algorithm additionally filters data for unwwanted 'swapped' 
indexes, unidentifiable indexes, and low quality index and sequences data. This program is beneficial 
for determining which sequences came from which samples after they have all be sequenced in conjunction.
